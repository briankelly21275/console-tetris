# terminal-tetris  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/semack/terminal-tetris.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/semack/terminal-tetris)
The multi-platform TETRIS game designed for text terminals.

This port of [Aleksey's Pajitnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov) TETRIS version has been created on my inspiration from my childhood time and experience playing it on  [DVK-3M](http://www.leningrad.su/museum/show_calc.php?n=241&lang=0&test=0) (soviet [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) clone) in the eighties.
