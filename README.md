The multi-platform [TETRIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) game designed for text terminals.

This port of [Aleksey's Pajitnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov) original TETRIS version has been created on my inspiration from my childhood time and experience playing it on  [DVK-3M](http://www.leningrad.su/museum/show_calc.php?n=241&lang=0&test=0) (soviet [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) clone) in the eighties.

Russian (original) / English localizations are supported.

<!--## Demo
